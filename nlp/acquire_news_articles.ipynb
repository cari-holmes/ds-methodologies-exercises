    "    Sports\n",
    "    Technology\n",
    "    Entertainment\n",

    "- Start by creating a function that handles a single article and produces a dictionary like the one above.\n",

    "- Now create a function that will use the previous two functions to scrape the articles from all the pages that you need, and do any additional processing that needs to be done.\n",

    "3. Write your code such that the acquired data is saved locally in some form or fashion. Your functions that retrieve the data should prefer to read the local data instead of having to make all the requests everytime the function is called. Include a boolean flag in the functions to allow the data to be acquired \"fresh\" from the actual sources (re-writing your local cache)."
