Is logerror significantly different for properties that are delinquent on their taxes vs those that are not? Is logerror significantly different for properties built prior to 1960 than those built later than 2000?\n",
    "    - Because there are many discrete variables, you can use the chi-squared test to test proportions. If you split logerror into quartiles, you can expect the overall probability of falling into a single quartile to be 25%. Now, add another variable, like bedrooms (and you can bin these if you want fewer distinct values) and compare the probabilities of bedrooms with logerror quartiles. See the example in the Classification_Project notebook we reviewed on how to implement chi-squared."
